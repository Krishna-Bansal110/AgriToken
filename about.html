            AgriToken is a blockchain-based platform that allows fractional ownership of farms through tokenized assets. 
            Investors can buy AgriTokens, representing shares in farming operations, and earn profits from farm yields.
            This system provides farmers with much-needed capital while ensuring transparency, security, and fair compensation through decentralized governance.
